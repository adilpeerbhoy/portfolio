# Portfolio Website

## Purpose
Currently I have a portfolio [website](https://www.adilpeerbhoy.com) built using a WordPress template from [NetworkChuck](https://youtu.be/e2h_BreIxaQ?si=iMqeBwLq-aLYODLt) (sample website using his template can be found [here](https://networkchuckresume.com/)). I would like to build this from scratch, allowing me to have more ganular control over certain aspects of the website along with being a learning experience. This is my first attempt at building a website outside of following YouTube tutorials.

## Goals
There are a few goals I'd like to achieve by coding the website myself.

- Timeline: I'd like to modify the work and education experience timeline sections in order to fit better on the screen. For example, splitting the content between both the left and right side of the timeline
- Blog: Adding a new blog section not found on the template, allowing me to share my work and updates in a central place
- Customization: Have more control over fonts, colors, and animations vis Javascript
